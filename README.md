# ForensicImages
Final project for the analysis of forensic images

# Original Pitch

In this project, I want to automate the labeling process of one million forensic images with the goal of detecting what stage of decomposition a corpse is at.

For this project three main skill-sets are required and any one with any of these skills is more than welcome to join me. 

### Web-development (mainly Javascript)
Improving the current online platform that facilitates the manual labeling process for gathering training data
### Image processing (using OpenCV and Pillow)
Applying various image processing techniques to preprocess the dataset before training, and using image augmentation to artificially increase the size of the training data. 
### Deep learning methods such as CNNs
Helping with model development, with the aim of detecting forensic features in trained images

# Milestones:
September 28: 
Finished project proposal. Presented plan on October 1st to the class. 

October 12:
Sara - 
Rosemary - explore the pre-trained imagnet models https://github.com/cvjena/cnn-models, read https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01452.pdf, figure out how to install caffe to run the model, know what should be the format of the input data if not stated in the above link, selected a model to download: AlexNet_cvgj first, apply model to a subset of images provided by sara

October 26:
Sara - 
Rosemary - Meet with Professor Mockus to discuss mean.js app goals. Change the code in /opt/mean.js/public/js/scr.js to add a tracking feature for visitation to images that are viewed but no label/tag was added. Look at the code where the image is loaded to add this information to the db. 
Goal: Apply to all 1M images (get final layer) and classify according to weather, gender, time from deposition, scale of the image: would such naive approach allow prescreening of images by scale, presence of feature, etc?
