# ForensicImages
Final project for the analysis of forensic images

# Original Pitch

In this project, I want to automate the labeling process of one million forensic images with the goal of detecting what stage of decomposition a corpse is at.

For this project three main skill-sets are required and any one with any of these skills is more than welcome to join me. 

### Web-development (mainly Javascript)
Improving the current online platform that facilitates the manual labeling process for gathering training data
### Image processing (using OpenCV and Pillow)
Applying various image processing techniques to preprocess the dataset before training, and using image augmentation to artificially increase the size of the training data. 
### Deep learning methods such as CNNs
Helping with model development, with the aim of detecting forensic features in trained images
